    - It's not 

        - file system based system, so you are not storing things as files

        - It's not block storage which stores data in blocks and sectors

[^1]: Answer

    - Transit encryption - SSL

    - Encryption at Rest: (SSE- Server Side Encryption)

        - SSE-AES - S3 handles key

        - SSE-KMS - AWS KMS and you manage the keys

        - SSE-C User manages keys

    - Client side encryption

        - User encrypt files before sending to S3

---
[^2]: Answer

    - Rather than uploading directly into S3, upload to CloudFront's edge location, which uses AWS Backbone network (specially optimized network path) to upload to S3

---
[^3]: [Answer](Answer)

    - Temporary URL that an application can use to download or upload S3 objects - Expires 5 seconds

---
[^4]: Answer

    - S3 Object

        - Key, Value, Version, Metadata

        - 0 bytes - 5 tb

    - S3 Bucket

        - Holds objects

        - Can contain folders

        - Unique name

---
[^5]: Answer

    - Buckets created private by default, AWS sends emails to remind about public S3s

    - Logs files saved in different bucket

    - Access control (Legacy) list VS Bucket policies (json)

---
[^6]: Answer

    - Insert new object is fast, and can access right away

    - Update/delete take 1-2 seconds to replicate. Possibility of returning old copy

---
[^7]: Answer

    - When enabled, auto replicates into multiple regions

    - Can also do different buckets, both buckets should have versioning on

---
[^8]: [Answer](Answer)

    - To prevent people from deleting S3 objects, MFA delete can be enabled

    - Needs versioning to be on

    - Only bucket owner logged in as a root user can delete

---
[^9]: Answer

    - Maintains different version

    - Can access any version

    - Once on, can only be suspended, but not off

---
[^10]: Answer

    - Can define rules like move to Glacier after 7 days and delete after a year

    - Can be used with versioning

---
[^11]: Answer

    - Simple Storage Service

    - Object based storage (not file based or block based)

    - S3 Object (0 bytes to 5 tb)

    - S3 bucket (holds objects and can have folders which hold objects)
